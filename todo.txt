Okay, we've run out of time. Need to submit on May 2nd, Actually maybe even tomorrow.



How to wrap up the game?

* Just add gravity wells and portals and more enemies and call it a day. 

Going towards that plan:
- Add blood splatter & heal
- Add shotgun alt click
- Add nailgun

- For final fight make a shitty gabriel
- Add a save data level lock system
- Add ranking
